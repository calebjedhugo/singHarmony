It came up- on the mid- night clear,
That glo- ri- ous song of old,
From an- gels bend- ing near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold;
“Peace on the earth, good will to men,
From Heav- en’s all gra- cious King.”
The world in sol- emn still- ness lay,
To hear the an- gels sing.

Still through the clo- ven skies they come
With peace- ful wings un- furled,
And still their heav- en- ly mu- sic floats
O’er all the wea- ry world;
A- bove its sad and low- ly plains,
They bend on hov- er- ing wing,
And ev- er o- ver its Ba- bel sounds
The blessèd an- gels sing.

And ye, be- neath life’s crush- ing load,
Whose forms are bend- ing low,
Who toil a- long the climb- ing way
With pain- ful steps and slow,
Look now! for glad and gold- en hours
Come swift- ly on the wing.
O rest be- side the wea- ry road,
And hear the an- gels sing!

For lo! the days are has- ten- ing on,
By proph- et- bards fore- told,
When with the ev- er cir- cl- ing years
Comes round the age of gold;
When peace shall o- ver all the earth
Its an- cient splen- dors fling,
And the whole world send back the song
Which now the an- gels sing.
