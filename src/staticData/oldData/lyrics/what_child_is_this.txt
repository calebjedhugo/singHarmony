What Child is this who, laid to rest
On Mar- yâ€™s lap is sleep- ing?
Whom an- gels greet with an- thems sweet,
While shep- herds watch are keep- ing?
This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shep- herds guard and an- gels sing;
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mar- y.

Why lies He in such mean es- tate,
Where ox and ass are feed- ing?
Good Chris- tians, fear, for sin- ners here
The si- lent Word is plead- ing.
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through,
The cross be borne for me, for you.
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
The Babe, the Son of Mar- y.

So bring Him in- cense, gold and myrrh,
Come peas- ant, king to own Him;
The King of kings sal- va- tion brings,
Let lov- ing hearts en- throne Him.
Raise, raise a song on high,
The vir- gin sings her lull- a- by.
Joy, joy for Christ is born,
The Babe, the Son of Mar- y.
