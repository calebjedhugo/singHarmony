Joy-ful, joy-ful, we a-dore Thee, God of glo-ry, Lord of love;
Hearts un-fold like flow-ers be-fore Thee, o-pen-ing to the sun a-bove.
Melt the clouds of sin and sad-ness; drive the dark of doubt a-way;
Giv-er of im-mor-tal glad-ness, fill us with the light of day!

All Thy works with joy sur-round Thee, earth and heav-en re-flect Thy rays,
Stars and an-gels sing a-round Thee, cen-ter of un-bro-ken praise.
Field and for-est, va-le and moun-tain, flow-er-y mead-ow, flash-ing sea,
Chant-ing bird and flow-ing foun-tain call us to re-joice in Thee.

Thou art giv-ing and for-giv-ing, ev-er bless-ing, ev-er bless-ed,
Well-spring of the joy of liv-ing, o-cean depth of hap-py rest!
Thou our Fa-ther, Christ our Broth-er, all who live in love are Thine;
Teach us how to love each oth-er, lift us to the joy di-vine.

Mor-tals, join the might-y cho-rus, which the morn-ing stars be-gan;
Fa-ther love is reign-ing oâ€™er us, broth-er love binds man to man.
Ev-er sing-ing, march we on-ward, vic-tors in the midst of strife,
Joy-ful mu-sic leads us sun-ward in the tri-umph song of life.
