How firm a foun-da-tion, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His ex-cel-lent Word!
What more can He say than to you He hath said,
To you, who for ref-uge to Je-sus have fled?

“Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dis-mayed,
For I am thy God and will still give thee aid;
I’ll strength-en and help thee, and cause thee to stand
Up-held by My right-eous, om-nip-o-tent hand.

“When through the deep wa-ters I call thee to go,
The riv-ers of woe shall not thee o-ver-flow;
For I will be with thee, thy trou-bles to bless,
And sanc-ti-fy to thee thy deep-est dis-tress.

“When through fier-y tri-als thy path-ways shall lie,
My grace, all suf-fi-cient, shall be thy sup-ply;
The flame shall not hurt thee; I on-ly de-sign
Thy dross to con-sume, and thy gold to re-fine.

“The soul that on Je-sus hath leaned for re-pose,
I will not, I will not de-sert to its foes;
That soul, though all hell should en-deav-or to shake,
I’ll nev-er, no nev-er, no nev-er for-sake.”
