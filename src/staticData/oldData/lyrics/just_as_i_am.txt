Just as I am, with-out one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, and wait-ing not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, though tossed a-bout
With man-y a con-flict, man-y a doubt,
Fight-ings and fears with-in, with-out,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, poor, wretch-ed, blind;
Sight, rich-es, heal-ing of the mind,
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, Thou wilt re-ceive,
Wilt wel-come, par-don, cleanse, re-lieve;
Be-cause Thy prom-ise I be-lieve,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
