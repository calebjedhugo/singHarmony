Shall we gath-er at the riv-er,
Where bright an-gel feet have trod,
With its crys-tal tide for-ev-er
Flow-ing by the throne of God?
Yes, we’ll gath-er at the riv-er,
The beau-ti-ful, the beau-ti-ful riv-er;
Gath-er with the saints at the riv-er
That flows by the throne of God.

On the bos-om of the riv-er,
Where the Sav-ior-King we own,
We shall meet and sor-row nev-er,
‘Neath the glo-ry of the throne.

Ere we reach the shin-ing riv-er,
Lay we eve-ry bur-den down;
Grace our spir-its will de-liv-er,
And pro-vide a robe and crown.

Soon we’ll reach the sil-ver riv-er,
Soon our pil-grim-age will cease;
Soon our hap-py hearts will quiv-er
With the mel-o-dy of peace.
