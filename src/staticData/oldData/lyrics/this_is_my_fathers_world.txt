This is my Fa-ther’s world, and to my lis-ten-ing ears
All na-ture sings, and round me rings the mu-sic of the spheres.
This is my Fa-ther’s world, I rest me in the thought
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
His hand the won-ders wrought.

This is my Fa-ther’s world, the birds their car-ols raise,
The morn-ing light, the lil-y white, de-clare their Mak-er’s praise.
This is my Fa-ther’s world, He shines in all that’s fair;
In the rus-tl-ing grass I hear Him pass,
He speaks to me eve-ry-where.

This is my Fa-ther’s world. O let me ne’er for-get
That though the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the rul-er yet.
This is my Fa-ther’s world, the bat-tle is not done;
Je-sus Who died shall be sat-is-fied,
And earth and Heav-en be one.
