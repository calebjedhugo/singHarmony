O for a thou-sand tongues to sing
My great Re-deem-er’s praise,
The glo-ries of my God and King,
The tri-umphs of His grace!

My gra-cious Mas-ter and my God,
As-sist me to pro-claim,
To spread through all the earth a-broad
The hon-ors of Thy name.

Je-sus! the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sor-rows cease;
’Tis mu-sic in the sin-ner’s ears,
’Tis life, and health, and peace.

He breaks the pow-er of can-celed sin,
He sets the pris-on-er free;
His blood can make the foul-est clean,
His blood a-vailed for me.

Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loos-ened tongues em-ploy;
Ye blind, be-hold your Sav-ior come,
And leap, ye lame, for joy.

Glo-ry to God, and praise and love
Be ev-er, ev-er giv-en,
By saints be-low and saints a-bove,
The church in earth and heav-en.
