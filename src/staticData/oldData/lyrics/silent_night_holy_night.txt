Si- lent night! Ho- ly night
All is calm all is bright
Round yong vir- gin moth- er and child
Ho- ly in- fant so ten- der and mild
Sleep in heav- en- ly peace!
Sleep in heav- en- ly peace!

Si- lent night! Ho- ly night!
Shep- herds quake at the sight
Glo- ries stream from heav- en a- far
Heav- en- ly hosts sing Hal- le- lu- jah
Christ the Sav- iour is born!
Christ the Sav- iour is born!

Si- lent night! Ho- ly night!
Son of God loveâ€™s pure light
Ra- di- ant beams from thy ho- ly face
With the dawn of re- deem- ing grace,
Je- sus, Lord at thy birth,
Je- sus, Lord at thy birth.
