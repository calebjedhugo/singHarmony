Low in the grave He lay, Je- sus my Sav- ior!
Wait- ing the com- ing day, Je- sus my Lord!
Up from the grave He a- rose,
With a might- y tri- umph oâ€™er His foes,
He a- rose a Vic- tor from the dark do- main,
And He lives for- ev- er, with His saints to reign.
He a- rose! He a- rose!
Hal- le- lu- jah! Christ a- rose!

Vain- ly they watch His bed, Je- sus my Sav- ior!
Vain- ly they seal the dead, Je- sus my Lord!

Death can- not keep its Prey, Je- sus my Sav- ior!
He tore the bars a- way, Je- sus my Lord!
