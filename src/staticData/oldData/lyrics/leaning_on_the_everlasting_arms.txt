What a fel-low-ship, what a joy di-vine,
Lean-ing on the ev-er-last-ing arms;
What a bless-ed-ness, what a peace is mine,
Lean-ing on the ev-er-last-ing arms.
Lean-ing, lean-ing, safe and se-cure from all a-larms;
Lean-ing, lean-ing, lean-ing on the ev-er-last-ing arms.

O how sweet to walk in this pil-grim way,
Lean-ing on the ev-er-last-ing arms;
O how bright the path grows from day to day,
Lean-ing on the ev-er-last-ing arms.

What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
Lean-ing on the ev-er-last-ing arms;
I have bless-ed peace with my Lord so near,
Lean-ing on the ev-er-last-ing arms.
