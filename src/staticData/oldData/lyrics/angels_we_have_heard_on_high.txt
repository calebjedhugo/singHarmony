An- gels we have heard on high
Sweet- ly sing- ing oâ€™er the plains,
And the moun- tains in re- ply
Ech- o- ing their joy- ous strains.
Glo- ri- a, in ex- cel- sis De- o!
Glo- ri- a, in ex- cel- sis De- o!

Shep- herds, why this ju- bi- lee?
Why your joy- ous strains pro- long?
Say, what may the tid- ings be
Which in- spire your heav- en- ly song?

Come to Beth- le- hem and see
Him Whose birth the an- gels sing;
Come, a- dore on bend- ed knee,
Christ the Lord, the new- born King.
