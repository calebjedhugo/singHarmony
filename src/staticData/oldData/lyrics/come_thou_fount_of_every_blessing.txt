Come, Thou Fount of eve-ry bless-ing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mer-cy, nev-er ceas-ing,
Call for songs of loud-est praise.
Teach me some me-lo-di-ous son-net,
Sung by flam-ing tongues a-bove.
Praise the mount! I’m fixed up-on it,
Mount of God’s un-chang-ing love.

Here I raise my Eb-e-ne-zer;
Here by Thy great help I’ve come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleas-ure,
Safe-ly to ar-rive at home.
Je-sus sought me when a stran-ger,
Wan-der-ing from the fold of God;
He, to res-cue me from dan-ger,
In-ter-posed His pre-cious blood;

O to grace how great a debt-or
Dai-ly I’m con-strained to be!
Let Thy grace now, like a fet-ter,
Bind my wan-der-ing heart to Thee.
Prone to wan-der, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here’s my heart, O take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts a-bove.
