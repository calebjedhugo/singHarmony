I hear the Sav-ior say,
“Thy strength in-deed is small;
Child of weak-ness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all.”
Je-sus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crim-son stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now in-deed I find
Thy pow-er and Thine a-lone,
Can change the lep-er’s spots
And melt the heart of stone.

For noth-ing good have I
Where-by Thy grace to claim,
I’ll wash my gar-ments white
In the blood of Cal-v’ry’s Lamb.

And when be-fore the throne
I stand in Him com-plete,
“Je-sus died my soul to save,”
My lips shall still re-peat.
