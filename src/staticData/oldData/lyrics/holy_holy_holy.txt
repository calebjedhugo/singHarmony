Ho-ly, ho-ly, ho-ly! Lord God Al-might-y!
Ear-ly in the morn-ing our song shall rise to Thee;
Ho-ly, ho-ly, ho-ly, mer-ci-ful and might-y!
God in three Per-sons, blessèd Trin-i-ty!

Ho-ly, ho-ly, ho-ly! All the saints a-dore Thee,
Cast-ing down their gold-en crowns a-round the glass-y sea;
Cher-u-bim and ser-a-phim fall-ing down be-fore Thee,
Which wert and art and ev-er-more shall be.

Ho-ly, ho-ly, ho-ly! though the dark-ness hide Thee,
Though the eye of sin-ful man Thy glo-ry may not see;
On-ly Thou art ho-ly; there is none be-side Thee,
Per-fect in pow-er, in love, and pu-ri-ty.

Ho-ly, ho-ly, ho-ly! Lord God Al-might-y!
All Thy works shall praise Thy Name, in earth, and sky, and sea;
Ho-ly, ho-ly, ho-ly; mer-ci-ful and might-y!
God in three Per-sons, blessèd Trin-i-ty!
