While shep- herds watched their flocks by night,
All seat- ed on the ground,
The an- gel of the Lord came down,
And glo- ry shone a- round,
And glo- ry shone a- round.

“Fear not!” said he, for might- y dread
Had seized their trou- bled mind.
“Glad tid- ings of great joy I bring
To you and all man- kind
To you and all man- kind.

“To you, in Da- vid’s town, this day
Is born of Da- vid’s line
A Sav- ior, who is Christ the Lord,
And this shall be the sign,
And this shall be the sign.

“The heav- en- ly Babe you there shall find
To hu- man view dis- played,
All mean- ly wrapped in swath- ing bands,
And in a man- ger laid,
And in a man- ger laid.”

“All glo- ry be to God on high,
And to the Earth be peace;
Good will hence- forth from Heav- en to men
Be- gin and nev- er cease,
Be- gin and nev- er cease!”
