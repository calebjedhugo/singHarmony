All glo- ry, laud and hon- or,
To Thee, Re- deem- er, King,
To Whom the lips of chil- dren
Made sweet ho- san- nas ring.
Thou art the King of Is-2 rael,
Thou Da- vid’s roy- al Son,
Who in the Lord’s Name com-2 est,
The King and Bless- èd One.

The com- pa- ny of an- gels
Are prais- ing Thee on High,
And mor- tal men and all things
Cre- at- ed make re- ply.
The peo- ple of the He-2 brews
With palms be- fore Thee went;
Our prayer and praise and an-2 thems
Be- fore Thee we pre- sent.

To Thee, be- fore Thy pas- sion,
They sang their hymns of praise;
To Thee, now high ex- alt- ed,
Our mel- o- dy we raise.
Thou didst ac- cept their prais-2 es;
A- ccept the praise we bring,
Who in all good de- light-2 est,
Thou good and gra- cious King.
