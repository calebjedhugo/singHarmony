Breth- ren, we have met to wor- ship and a- dore the Lord our God;
Will you pray with all your pow- er, while we try to preach the Word?
All is vain un- less the Spir- it of the Ho- ly One comes down;
Breth- ren, pray, and ho- ly man- na will be show- ered all a- round.

Breth- ren, see poor sin- ners round you slum- ber- ing on the brink of woe;
Death is com- ing, hell is mov- ing, can you bear to let them go?
See our fa- thers and our moth- ers, and our chil- dren sink- ing down;
Breth- ren, pray and ho- ly man- na will be show- ered all a- round.

Sis- ters, will you join and help us? Mo- ses’ sis- ter aid- ed him;
Will you help the trem- bling mourn- ers who are strug- gl- ing hard with sin?
Tell them all a- bout the Sav- ior, tell them that He will be found;
Sis- ters, pray, and ho- ly man- na will be show- ered all a- round.

Let us love our God su- preme- ly, let us love each oth- er, too;
Let us love and pray for sin- ners, till our God makes all things new.
Then He’ll call us home to Heav- en, at His ta- ble we’ll sit down;
Christ will gird Him- self and serve us with sweet man- na all a- round.
