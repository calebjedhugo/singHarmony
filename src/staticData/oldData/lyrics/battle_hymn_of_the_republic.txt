Mine eyes have seen the glo- ry of the com- ing of the Lord;
He is tram- pling out the vin- tage where grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fate- ful light- ning of His ter- ri- ble swift sword,
His truth is march- ing on.
Glo- ry, glo- ry, hal- le- lu- jah! Glo- ry, glo- ry, hal- le- lu- jah!
Glo- ry, glo- ry, hal- le- lu- jah! His truth is march- ing on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires of a hun- dred cir- cl- ing camps;
They have build- ed Him an al- tar in the eve- ning dews and damps;
I can read His right- eous sen- tence by the dim and flar- ing lamps,
His day is march- ing on.

He has sound- ed forth the trum- pet that shall nev- er call re- treat;
He is sift- ing out the hearts of men be- fore His Judge- ment Seat.
Oh! Be swift, my soul, to an- swer Him, be ju- bi- lant, my feet!
Our God is march- ing on.

In the beau- ty of the lil- ies Christ was born a- cross the sea,
With a glo- ry in his bos- om that trans- fig- ures you and me;
As he died to make men ho- ly, let us live to make men free,
While God is march- ing on.
