Go to dark Gethsemane, you that feel the tempter’s power;
Your Redeemer’s conflict see, watch with Him one bitter hour,
Turn not from His griefs away; learn of Jesus Christ to pray.

Follow to the judgment hall, View the Lord of life arraigned;
O the wormwood and the gall! O the pangs His soul sustained!
Shun not suffering, shame or loss; Learn of Him to bear the cross

Calvary’s mournful mountain climb; There, adoring at His feet,
Mark the miracle of time, God’s own sacrifice complete:
“It is finished!” hear Him cry; Learn of Jesus Christ to die.
