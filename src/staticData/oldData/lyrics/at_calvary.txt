Years I spent in van-i-ty and pride,
Car-ing not my Lord was cru-ci-fied,
Know-ing not it was for me He died on Cal-va-ry.
Mer-cy there was great, and grace was free;
Par-don there was mul-ti-plied to me;
There my bur-dened soul found lib-er-ty at Cal-va-ry.

By God’s Word at last my sin I learn-ed;
Then I trem-bled at the law I’d spurned,
Till my guilt-y soul im-plor-ing turned to Cal-va-ry.

Now I’ve giv-en to Je-sus eve-ry-thing,
Now I glad-ly own Him as my King,
Now my rap-tured soul can on-ly sing of Cal-va-ry!

Oh, the love that drew sal-va-tion’s plan!
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man!
Oh, the might-y gulf that God did span at Cal-va-ry!
