The first No-el the an-gel did say
Was to cer-tain poor shep-herds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay tend-ing their sheep,
On a cold win-terâ€™s night that was so deep.
No-el, No-el, No-el, No-el,
Born is the King of Is-ra-el.

Then did ap-pear a won-drous star
Shin-ing in the east, be-yond them far;
Un-to the earth it gave great light,
And so it con-tin-ued both day and night.

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise Men came from coun-try far;
To seek for a King was their in-tent,
And to fol-low the star wher-ev-er it went.

Now let us all with one ac-cord
Sing prais-es to our heav-en-ly Lord;
That hath made Heav-en and earth of naught,
And with His blood man-kind hath bought.
