My coun-try, ’tis of thee,
Sweet land of lib-er-ty,
Of thee I sing;
Land where my fa-thers died,
Land of the pil-grims’ pride,
From eve-ry moun-tain-side,
Let free-dom ring!

My na-tive coun-try, thee,
Land of the no-ble free,
Thy name I love;
I love thy rocks and rills,
Thy woods and tem-pled hills;
My heart with rap-ture thrills,
Like that a-bove.

Let mu-sic swell the breeze,
And ring from all the trees,
Sweet free-dom’s song;
Let mor-tal tongues a-wake;
Let all that breathe par-take;
Let rocks their si-lence break,
The sound pro-long.

Our fa-thers’ God, to Thee,
Au-thor of lib-er-ty,
To Thee we sing;
Long may our land be bright
With free-dom’s ho-ly light;
Pro-tect us by Thy might,
Great God, our King.
