I come to the gar- den a- lone
While the dew is still on the ros- es
And the voice I hear fall- ing on my ear
The Son of God dis- clos- es.
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own;
And the joy we share as we tar- ry there,
None oth- er has ev- er known.

He speaks, and the sound of His voice,
Is so sweet the birds hush their sing- ing,
And the mel- o- dy that He gave to me
With- in my heart is ring- ing.

Iâ€™d stay in the gar- den with Him
Though the night a- round me be fall- ing,
But He bids me go; through the voice of woe
His voice to me is call- ing.
