Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure;
Save from wrath and make me pure.

Could my tears forever flow,
Could my zeal no respite know,
This for sin could not atoneâ€“
Thou must save, and Thou alone:
In my hand no price I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling.

While I draw my final breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.
