Rock of Ag- es, cleft for me,
Let me hide my- self in Thee;
Let the wa- ter and the blood,
From Thy wound- ed side which flowed,
Be of sin the dou- ble cure;
Save from wrath and make me pure.

Could my tears for- ev- er flow,
Could my zeal no res- pite know,
This for sin could not a- toneâ€“
Thou must save, and Thou a- lone:
In my hand no price I bring,
Sim- ply to Thy cross I cling.

While I draw my fi- nal breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds un- known,
And be- hold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ag- es, cleft for me,
Let me hide my- self in Thee.
