A- maz- ing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears re- lieved;
How pre- cious did that grace ap- pear
The hour I first be- lieved!

The Lord has prom- ised good to me,
His Word my hope se- cures;
He will my Shield and Por- tion be,
As long as life en- dures.

Through man- y dan- gers, toils and snares,
I have al- read- y come;
’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

When we’ve been there ten thou- sand years,
Bright shin- ing as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we’d first be- gun.
