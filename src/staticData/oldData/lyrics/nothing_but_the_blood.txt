What can wash a-way my sin?
Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus;
What can make me whole a-gain?
Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus.
Oh! pre-cious is the flow
That makes me white as snow;
No oth-er fount I know,
Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus.

For my par-don, this I see,
Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus;
For my cleans-ing this my plea,
Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus.

Noth-ing can for sin a-tone,
Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus;
Naught of good that I have done,
Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus.

This is all my hope and peace,
Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus;
This is all my right-eous-ness,
Noth-ing but the blood of Je-sus.
