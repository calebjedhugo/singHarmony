Take my life and let it be con-se-crat-ed, Lord, to Thee.
Take my mo-ments and my days; let them flow in cease-less praise.

Take my hands and let them move at the im-pulse of Thy love.
Take my feet and let them be swift and beau-ti-ful for Thee.

Take my voice and let me sing al-ways, on-ly, for my King.
Take my lips and let them be filled with mes-sag-es from Thee.

Take my sil-ver and my gold; not a mite would I with-hold.
Take my in-tel-lect and use eve-ry pow-er as Thou shalt choose.

Take my will and make it Thine; it shall be no long-er mine.
Take my heart it is Thine own; it shall be Thy roy-al throne.

Take my love my Lord, I pour at Thy feet its treas-ure store.
Take my-self and I will be ev-er, on-ly, all for Thee.
