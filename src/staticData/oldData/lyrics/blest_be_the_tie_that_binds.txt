Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Chris- tian love;
The fel- low- ship of kin- dred minds
Is like to that a- bove.

Be- fore our Fa- therâ€™s throne
We pour our ar- dent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one
Our com- forts and our cares.

We share our mu- tu- al woes,
Our mu- tu- al bur- dens bear;
And of- ten for each oth- er flows
The sym- pa- thiz- ing tear.

When we a- sun- der part,
It gives us in- ward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet a- gain.
