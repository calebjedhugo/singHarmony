There is a foun-tain filled with blood
Drawn from Im-man-u-el’s veins,
And sin-ners plunged be-neath that flood
Lose all their guilt-y stains.

The dy-ing thief re-joiced to see
That foun-tain in his day,
And there may I, though vile as he
Wash all my sins a-way.

Dear dy-ing Lamb, thy pre-cious blood
Shall nev-er lose its pow-er,
Till all the ran-somed church of God
Are saved, to sin no more.

E’re since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flow-ing wounds sup-ply,
Re-deem-ing love has been my theme
and shall be till I die.

When this poor lisp-ing, stam-mer-ing tongue
Lies si-lent in the grave,
Then in a nobl-er, sweet-er song
I’ll sing thy pow-er to save.
