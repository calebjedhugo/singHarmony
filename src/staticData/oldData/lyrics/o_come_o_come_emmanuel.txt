O come, O come, Em- ma- nu- el
And ran- som cap- tive Is- ra- el
That mourns in lone- ly ex- ile here
Un- til the Son of God ap- pear
Re- joice! Re- joice! Em- ma- nu- el
Shall come to thee, O Is- ra- el.

O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Sa- tan’s tyr- an- ny
From depths of Hell Thy peo- ple save
And give them vic- to- ry o’er the grave
Re- joice! Re- joice! Em- ma- nu- el
Shall come to thee, O Is- ra- el.

O come, Thou Day- Spring, come and cheer
Our spir- its by Thine ad- vent here
Dis- perse the gloom- y clouds of night
And death’s dark shad- ows put to flight.
Re- joice! Re- joice! Em- ma- nu- el
Shall come to thee, O Is- ra- el.

O come, Thou Key of Da- vid, come,
And o- pen wide our heav- en- ly home;
Where all Thy saints with Thee shall dwell~
O come, O come, Em- ma- nu- el
Re- joice! Re- joice! Em- ma- nu- el
Shall come to thee, O Is- ra- el.
