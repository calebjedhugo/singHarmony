An-gels from the realms of glo-ry,
Wing your flight o’er all the earth;
Ye who sang cre-a-tion’s sto-ry
Now pro-claim Mes-si-ah’s birth.
Come and wor-ship, come and wor-ship,
Wor-ship Christ, the new-born King.

Shep-herds, in the field a-bid-ing,
Watch-ing o’er your flocks by night,
God with us is now re-sid-ing;
Yon-der shines the in-fant light:

SAGE-es, leave your con-tem-pla-tions,
Bright-er vi-sions beam a-far;
Seek the great De-sire of na-tions;
Ye have seen His na-tal star.

Saints, be-fore the al-tar bend-ing,
Watch-ing long in hope and fear;
Sud-den-ly the Lord, de-scend-ing,
In His tem-ple shall ap-pear.
