My hope is built on noth- ing less
Than Je- sus’ blood and right- eous- ness.
I dare not trust the sweet- est frame,
But whol- ly trust in Je- sus’ Name.
On Christ the sol- id Rock I stand,
All oth- er ground is sink- ing sand;
All oth- er ground is sink- ing sand.

When dark- ness veils His love- ly face,
I rest on His un- chang- ing grace.
In eve- ry high and storm- y gale,
My an- chor holds with- in the veil.

His oath, His cov- e- nant, His blood,
Sup- port me in the whelm- ing flood.
When all a- round my soul gives way,
He then is all my Hope and Stay.

When He shall come with trum- pet sound,
Oh may I then in Him be found.
Dressed in His right- eous- ness a- lone,
Fault- less to stand be- fore the throne.
