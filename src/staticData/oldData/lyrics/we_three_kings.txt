We three kings of O-ri-ent are;
Bear-ing gifts we trav-erse a-far,
Field and foun-tain, moor and moun-tain,
Fol-low-ing yon-der star.
O star of won-der, star of light,
Star with roy-al beau-ty bright,
West-ward lead-ing, still pro-ceed-ing,
Guide us to thy per-fect light.

Born a King on Beth-le-hemâ€™s plain
Gold I bring to crown Him a-gain,
King for-ev-er, ceas-ing nev-er,
O-ver us all to reign.

Frank-in-cense to of-fer have I;
In-cense owns a De-i-ty nigh;
Prayer and prais-ing, voic-es rais-ing,
Wor-ship-ping God on high.

Myrrh is mine, its bit-ter per-fume
Breathes a life of gath-er-ing gloom;
Sor-row-ing, sigh-ing, bleed-ing, dy-ing,
Sealed in the stone cold tomb.

Glo-ri-ous now be-hold Him a-rise;
King and God and sac-ri-fice;
Al-le-lu-ia, Al-le-lu-ia,
Sounds through the earth and skies.
