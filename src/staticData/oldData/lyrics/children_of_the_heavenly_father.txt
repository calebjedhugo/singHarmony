Chil- dren of the heav- en- ly Fa- ther
Safe- ly in His bos- om gath- er;
Nest- ling bird nor star in heav- en
Such a ref- uge e’er was giv- en.

God His own doth tend and nour- ish,
In His ho- ly courts they flour- ish;
From all e- vil things He spares them,
In His might- y arms He bears them.

Nei- ther life nor death shall ev- er
From the Lord His chil- dren sev- er;
Un- to them His grace He showeth,
And their sor- rows all He knoweth.

Though He giveth or He taketh,
God His chil- dren ne’er forsaketh;
His the lov- ing pur- pose sole- ly
To pre- serve them pure and ho- ly.
