Praise Him! Praise Him! Je- sus, our blessèd Re- deem- er!
Sing, O Earth, His won- der- ful love pro- claim!
Hail Him! hail Him! high- est arch- an- gels in glo- ry;
Strength and hon- or give to His ho- ly Name!
Like a shep- herd, Je- sus will guard His chil- dren,
In His arms He car- ries them all day long:

Praise Him! Praise Him! Je- sus, our blessèd Re- deem- er!
For our sins He suf- fered, and bled, and died.

Hail Him! hail Him! Je- sus the Cru- ci- fied.
Sound His prais- es! Je- sus who bore our sor- rows,
Love un- bound- ed, won- der- ful, deep and strong.

Praise Him! Praise Him! Je- sus, our blessèd Re- deem- er!
Heav’n- ly por- tals loud with ho- san- nas ring!

Crown Him! Crown Him! Proph- et, and Priest, and King!
Christ is com- ing! o- ver the world vic- to- ri- ous,
Pow’r and glo- ry un- to the Lord be- long.
