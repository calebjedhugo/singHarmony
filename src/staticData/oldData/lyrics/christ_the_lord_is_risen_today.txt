Christ, the Lord, is ris- en to- day, Al- le- lu- ia!
Sons of men and an- gels say, Al- le- lu- ia!
Raise your joys and tri- umphs high, Al- le- lu- ia!
Sing, ye heav- ens, and earth, re- ply, Al- le- lu- ia!

Lives a- gain our glo- ri- ous King, Al- le- lu- ia!
Where, O death, is now thy sting? Al- le- lu- ia!
Dy- ing once He all doth save, Al- le- lu- ia!
Where thy vic- to- ry, O grave? Al- le- lu- ia!

Loveâ€™s re- deem- ing work is done, Al- le- lu- ia!
Fought the fight, the bat- tle won, Al- le- lu- ia!
Death in vain for- bids Him rise, Al- le- lu- ia!
Christ has o- pened Par- a- dise, Al- le- lu- ia!

Soar we now where Christ hath led, Al- le- lu- ia!
Fol- low- ing our ex- alt- ed Head, Al- le- lu- ia!
Made like Him, like Him we rise, Al- le- lu- ia!
Ours the cross, the grave, the skies, Al- le- lu- ia!
