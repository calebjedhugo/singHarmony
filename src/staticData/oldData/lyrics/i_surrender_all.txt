All to Je- sus, I sur- ren- der;
All to Him I free- ly give;
I will ev- er love and trust Him,
In His pres- ence dai- ly live.
I sur- ren- der all, I sur- ren- der all,
All to Thee, my bless√®d Sav- ior,
I sur- ren- der all.

All to Je- sus I sur- ren- der;
Hum- bly at His feet I bow,
World- ly pleas- ures all for- sak- en;
Take me, Je- sus, take me now.

All to Je- sus, I sur- ren- der;
Make me, Sav- ior, whol- ly Thine;
Let me feel the Ho- ly Spir- it,
Tru- ly know that Thou art mine.

All to Je- sus, I sur- ren- der;
Lord, I give my- self to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and pow- er;
Let Thy bless- ing fall on me.
