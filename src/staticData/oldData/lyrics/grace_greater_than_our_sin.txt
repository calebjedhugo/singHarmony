Mar-vel-ous grace of our lov-ing Lord,
Grace that ex-ceeds our sin and our guilt!
Yon-der on Cal-va-ry’s mount out-poured,
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.
Grace, grace, God’s grace,
Grace that will par-don and cleanse with-in;
Grace, grace, God’s grace,
Grace that is great-er than all our sin.

Sin and de-spair, like the sea waves cold,
Threat-en the soul with in-fi-nite loss;
Grace that is great-er, yes, grace un-told,
Points to the ref-uge, the might-y cross.

Dark is the stain that we can-not hide.
What can a-vail to wash it a-way?
Look! There is flow-ing a crim-son tide,
Whit-er than snow you may be to-day.

Mar-vel-ous, in-fi-nite, match-less grace,
Free-ly be-stowed on all who be-lieve!
You that are long-ing to see His face,
Will you this mo-ment His grace re-ceive?
