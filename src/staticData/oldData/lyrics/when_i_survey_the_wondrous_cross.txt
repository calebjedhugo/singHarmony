When I sur-vey the won-drous cross
On which the Prince of Glo-ry died,
My rich-est gain I count but loss,
And pour con-tempt on all my pride.

For-bid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God,
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sac-ri-fice them to His blood.

See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sor-row and love flow min-gled down,
Did eâ€™er such love and sor-row meet,
Or thorns com-pose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of na-ture mine,
That were a pre-sent far too small;
Love so a-maz-ing, so di-vine,
De-mands my soul, my life, my all.
