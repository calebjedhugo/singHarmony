To God be the glo-ry, great things He hath done;
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
Who yield-ed His life an a-tone-ment for sin,
And o-pened the life gate that all may go in.
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the peo-ple re-joice!
O come to the Fa-ther, through Je-sus the Son,
And give Him the glo-ry, great things He hath done.

O per-fect re-demp-tion, the pur-chase of blood,
To eve-ry be-liev-er the prom-ise of God;
The vil-est of-fend-er who tru-ly be-lieves,
That mo-ment from Je-sus a par-don re-ceives.

Great things He hath taught us, great things He has done,
And great our re-joic-ing through Je-sus the Son;
But pur-er, and high-er, and great-er will be
Our won-der, our trans-port, when Je-sus we see.
