O come, all ye faith-ful, joy-ful and tri-um-phant,
Come ye, O come ye, to Beth-le-hem.
Come and be-hold Him, born the King of an-gels;
O come, let us a-dore Him,
O come, let us a-dore Him,
O come, let us a-dore Him,
Christ the Lord.

Sing, choirs of an-gels, sing in ex-ul-ta-tion;
Sing, all ye bright hosts of heav-en a-bove!
Glo-ry to God, all glo-ry in the high-est;

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this hap-py morn-ing;
Je-sus, to Thee be glo-ry giv-en;
Word of the Fa-ther, now in flesh ap-pear-ing.
