All hail the pow- er of Je- sus’ Name! Let an- gels pros- trate fall;
Bring forth the roy- al di- a- dem, and crown Him Lord of all.
Bring forth the roy- al di- a- dem, and crown Him Lord of all.

Ye cho- sen seed of Is- ra- el’s race, ye ran- somed from the fall,
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all.
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all.

Let eve- ry kin- dred, eve- ry tribe, On this ter- res- tri- al ball,
To Him all maj- es- ty as- cribe, And crown Him Lord of All;
To Him all maj- es- ty as- cribe, And crown Him Lord of All;

O that, with yon- der sa- cred throng, we at His feet may fall,
Join in the ev- er- last- ing song, and crown Him Lord of all,
Join in the ev- er- last- ing song, and crown Him Lord of all!
