Bring forth the roy- al di-4 a-4 dem, and crown Him Lord - - of all.

Let eve- ry kin- dred, eve- ry tribe, On this ter- res- trial ball,
To Him all maj- es- ty4 as-4 cribe, And crown Him Lord of2 all;
To Him all maj- es- ty4 as-4 cribe, And crown Him Lord - - of all;

O that, with yon- der sa- cred throng, we at His feet may fall,
Join in the ev- er- last-4 ing4 song, and crown Him Lord of2 all,
Join in the ev- er- last-4 ing4 song, and crown Him Lord - - of all!
