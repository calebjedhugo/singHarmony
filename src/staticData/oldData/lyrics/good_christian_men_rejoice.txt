Good Chris-tian men, re-joice with heart and soul, and voice;
Give ye heed to what we say: News! News! Je-sus Christ is born to-day;
Ox and ass be-fore Him bow; and He is in the man-ger now.
Christ is born to-day! Christ is born to-day!

Good Chris-tian men, re-joice, with heart and soul and voice;
Now ye hear of end-less bliss: Joy! Joy! Je-sus Christ was born for this!
He has o-pened the heav-enâ€™s door, and man is bless-ed for-ev-er-more.
Christ was born for this! Christ was born for this!

Good Chris-tian men, re-joice, with heart and soul and voice;
Now ye need not fear the grave: Peace! Peace! Je-sus Christ was born to save!
Calls you one and calls you all, to gain His ev-er-last-ing hall.
Christ was born to save! Christ was born to save!
