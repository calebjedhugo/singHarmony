A might- y for-4 tress is4 our God, a bul- wark nev- er fail-2 ing;
Our help- er He,4 a- mid4 the flood of mor- tal ills pre- vail-2 ing:
For still our an- cient foe doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and pow'r are great, and, armed with cru-4 el hate,
On earth is not his4 e-2 qual.

Did we in our4 own strength4 con- fide, our striv- ing would be los-2 ing;
Were not the right4 Man on4 our side, the Man of God’s own choos-2 ing:
Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jes- us, it is He;
Lord Sab- a- oth, His Name, from age to age4 the same,
And He must win the4 bat-2 tle.

And though this world,4 with dev-4 ils filled, should threa- ten to un- do2 us,
We will not fear,4 for God4 hath willed His truth to tri- umph through2 us:
The Prince of Dark- ness grim, we trem- ble not for him;
His rage we can en- dure, for lo, his doom4 is sure,
One lit- tle word shall4 fell2 him.

That word a- bove4 all earth-4 ly pow'rs, no thanks to them, a- bid-2 eth;
The Spir- it and4 the gifts4 are ours through Him Who with us sid-2 eth:
Let goods and kin- dred go, this mor- tal life al- so;
The bo- dy they may kill: God’s truth a- bid-4 eth still,
His king- dom is for-4 ev-2 er.
