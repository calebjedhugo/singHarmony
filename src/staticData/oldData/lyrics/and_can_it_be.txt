And can it be that I should gain
An in- ter- est in the Sav- ior’s blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain—
For me, who Him to death pur- sued?
A- maz- ing love! How can it be,
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
A- maz- ing love! How can it be,
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

He left His Fa- ther’s throne a- bove
So free, so in- fi- nite His grace—
Emp- tied Him- self of all but love,
And bled for Ad- am’s help- less race:
’Tis mer- cy all, im- mense and free,
For O my God, it found out me!
A- maz- ing love! How can it be,
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

Long my im- pris- oned spir- it lay,
Fast bound in sin and na- ture’s night;
Thine eye dif- fused a quick- en- ing ray—
I woke, the dun- geon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose, went forth, and fol- lowed Thee.
A- maz- ing love! How can it be,
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

No con- dem- na- tion now I dread;
Je- sus, and all in Him, is mine;
A- live in Him, my liv- ing Head,
And clothed in right- eous- ness di- vine,
Bold I ap- proach th’e- ter- nal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.
A- maz- ing love! How can it be,
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
