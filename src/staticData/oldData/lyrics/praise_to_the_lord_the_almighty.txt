Praise to the Lord, the Al-might-y, the King of cre-a-tion!
O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and sal-va-tion!
All ye who hear, now to His tem-ple draw near;
Praise Him in glad ad-o-ra-tion.

Praise to the Lord Who o’er all things so won-drous-ly reign-eth,
Shel-ters thee un-der His wings, yea, so gen-tly sustaineth!
Hast thou not seen how thy de-sires e’er have been
Grant-ed in what He ordaineth?

Praise to the Lord Who doth pros-per thy work and de-fend thee;
Sure-ly His good-ness and mer-cy here dai-ly at-tend thee.
Pon-der a-new what the Al-might-y can do
If with His love He be-friend thee.

Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me a-dore Him!
All that hath life and breath,
Come now with prais-es be-fore Him.
Let the A-men sound from His peo-ple a-gain,
Glad-ly for-ev-er a-dore Him.
