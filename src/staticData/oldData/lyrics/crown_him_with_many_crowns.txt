Crown Him with man-y crowns, the Lamb up-on His throne.
Hark! How the heav-en-ly an-them drowns all mu-sic but its own.
A-wake, my soul, and sing of Him who died for thee,
And hail Him as thy match-less King through all e-ter-ni-ty.

Crown Him the Lord of love, be-hold His hands and side,
Those wounds, yet vis-i-ble a-bove, in beau-ty glo-ri-fied.
No an-gel in the sky can ful-ly bear that sight,
But down-ward bends his burn-ing eye at mys-ter-ies so bright.

Crown Him the Lord of life, who tri-umphed o-ver the grave,
And rose vic-to-ri-ous in the strife for those He came to save.
His glo-ries now we sing, who died, and rose on high,
Who died e-ter-nal life to bring, and lives that death may die.

Crown Him the Lord of heav-en, one with the Fa-ther known,
One with the Spir-it thru Him giv-en from yon-der glo-ri-ous throne.
To Thee be end-less praise, for Thou for us hast died;
Be Thou, O Lord, thru end-less days A-dored and mag-ni-fied.
