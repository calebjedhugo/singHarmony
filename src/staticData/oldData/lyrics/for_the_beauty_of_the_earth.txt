For the beau-ty of the earth
For the glo-ry of the skies,
For the love which from our birth
O-ver and a-round us lies.
Lord of all, to Thee we raise,
This our hymn of grate-ful praise.

For the beau-ty of each hour,
Of the day and of the night,
Hill and va-le, and tree and flow-er,
Sun and moon, and stars of light.

For the joy of ear and eye,
For the heart and mindâ€™s de-light,
For the mys-tic har-mo-ny
Link-ing sense to sound and sight.

For the warmth of hu-man love,
Broth-er, sis-ter, par-ent, child,
Friends on earth and friends a-bove,
For all gen-tle thoughts and mild.

For Thy Church, that ev-er-more
Lifteth ho-ly hands a-bove,
Of-fer-ing up on eve-ry shore
Her pure sac-ri-fice of love.
