Face to face with Christ, my Sav- ior,
Face to face, what will it be?
When with rap- ture I be- hold Him,
Je- sus Christ Who died for me!
Face to face I shall be- hold Him,
Far be- yond the star- ry sky;
Face to face in all His glo- ry,
I shall see Him by and by!

On- ly faint- ly now I see Him,
With the dark- ling veil be- tween;
But a bless’d day is com- ing,
When His glo- ry shall be seen.

What re- joic- ing in His pres- ence,
When are ban- ished grief and pain;
When the crook- ed ways are straight- ened
And the dark things shall be plain.

Face to face–oh, bliss- ful mo- ment!
Face to face–to see and know;
Face to face with my Re- deem- er,
Je- sus Christ Who loves me so.
