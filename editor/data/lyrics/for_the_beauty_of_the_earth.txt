For the _ beau- ty of the earth
For the glo- ry of the skies,
For the _ love which from our birth
O- ver and a- round us lies.
Lord of all, to Thee we raise,
This our hymn of grate- ful praise.

For the _ beau- ty of each hour,
Of the day and of the night,
Hill and _ vale, and tree and flow'r,
Sun and moon, and stars of light.

For the _ joy of ear and eye,
For the heart and mindâ€™s de- light,
For the _ mys- tic har- mo- ny
Link- ing sense to sound and sight.

For the _ warmth of hu- man love,
Broth- er, sis- ter, par- ent, child,
Friends on _ earth and friends a- bove,
For all gen- tle thoughts and mild.

For Thy _ Church, that ev- er- more
Lift- eth ho- ly hands a- bove,
Of- f'ring _ up on eve- ry shore
Her pure sac- ri- fice of love.
