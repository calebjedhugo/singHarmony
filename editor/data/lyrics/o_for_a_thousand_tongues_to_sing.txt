O for a thou- sand tongues to sing
My great Re- deem- er’s praise,
The glo- ries of my God and King,
The _ tri- umphs of His grace!

My gra- cious Mas- ter and my God,
As- sist me to pro- claim,
To spread through all the earth a- broad
The _ hon- ors of Thy name.

Je- sus! the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sor- rows cease;
’Tis mu- sic in the sin- ner’s ears,
’Tis _ life, and health, and peace.

He breaks the pow'r of can- celed sin,
He sets the pris- 'ner free;
His blood can make the foul- est clean,
His _ blood a- vailed for me.

Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loos- ened tongues em- ploy;
Ye blind, be- hold your Sav- ior come,
And _ leap, ye lame, for joy.

Glo- ry to God, and praise and love
Be ev- er, ev- er giv'n,
By saints be- low and saints a- bove,
The _ church in earth and heav'n.
