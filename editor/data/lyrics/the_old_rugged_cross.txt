On a hill far a- way stood an old rug- ged cross,
The _ em- blem of suf- f'ring and shame; _
And I love that old cross where the dear- est and best
For a world of lost sin- ners was slain. _
So I’ll cher- ish the old rug- ged cross,
Till my tro- phies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rug- ged cross,
And ex- change it some day for a crown.

O that old rug- ged cross, so de- spised by the world,
Has a won- drous at- trac- tion for me; _
For the dear Lamb of God left His glo- ry a- bove
To _ bear it to dark Cal- va- ry. _

In that old rug- ged cross, stained with blood so di- vine,
A _ won - drous beau- ty I see, _
For ’twas on that old cross Je- sus suf- fered and died,
To _ par- don and sanc- ti- fy me. _

To the old rug- ged cross I will ev- er be true;
Its _ shame and re- proach glad- ly bear; _
Then He’ll call me some day to my home far a- way,
Where His glo- ry for- ev- er I’ll share. _
