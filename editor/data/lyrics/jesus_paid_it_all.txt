I _ hear the Sav- ior say,
“Thy strength in- deed is small;
Child of weak- ness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all.”
Je- sus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crim- son stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, _ now in- deed I find
Thy pow'r and Thine a- lone,
Can _ change the lep- er’s spots
And _ melt the heart of stone.

For _ noth- ing good have I
Where- by Thy grace to claim,
I’ll _ wash my gar- ments white
In the blood of Cal- v’ry’s Lamb.

And _ when be- fore the throne
I stand in Him com- plete,
“Je- sus died my soul to save,”
My _ lips shall still re- peat.
