Shall we gath- er at the riv- er,
Where bright an- gel feet have trod, _
With its crys- tal tide for- ev- er
Flow- ing by the _ throne of _ God?
Yes, we’ll gath- er at the riv- er,
The beau- ti- ful, the beau- ti- ful _ riv- er;
Gath- er with the saints _ at the riv- er
That flows by the throne of _ God.

On the bos- om of the riv- er,
Where the Sav- ior- King we own, _
We shall meet and sor- row nev- er,
‘Neath the glo- ry _ of the _ throne.

Ere we reach the shin- ing riv- er,
Lay we eve- ry bur- den down; _
Grace our spir- its will de- liv- er,
And pro- vide a _ robe and _ crown.

Soon we’ll reach the sil- ver riv- er,
Soon our pil- grim- age will cease; _
Soon our hap- py hearts will quiv- er
With the mel- o - dy of _ peace.
