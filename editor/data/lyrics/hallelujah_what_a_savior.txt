Man of Sor- rows! what a name
For the Son of God, who came
Ru- ined sin- ners to re- claim.
Hal- le- lu- jah! What a Sav- ior!

Bear- ing shame and scoff- ing rude,
In my place con- demned He stood;
Sealed my par- don with His blood.
Hal- le- lu- jah! What a Sav- ior!

Guilt- y, vile, and help- less we;
Spot- less Lamb of God was He;
“Full a- tone- ment!” can it be?
Hal- le- lu- jah! What a Sav- ior!

Lift- ed up was He to die;
“It is fin- ished!” was His cry;
Now in Heav’n ex- alt- ed high.
Hal- le- lu- jah! What a Sav- ior!

When He comes, our glo- rious King,
All His ran- somed home to bring,
Then a- new His song we’ll sing:
Hal- le- lu- jah! What a Sav- ior!
