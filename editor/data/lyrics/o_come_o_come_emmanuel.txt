O come, O come, Em- ma - - nu- el
And ran- som cap- tive Is - - ra- el
That mourns in lone- ly ex - ile here
Un- til the Son of God _ _ ap- pear.
Re- joice! Re- joice! Em- ma - - nu- el
Shall come to thee, O Is - - ra- el.

O come, Thou Rod of Jes - - se, free
Thine own from Sa- tan’s tyr - - an- ny
From depths of Hell Thy peo - ple save
And give them vic- t'ry o’er _ _ the grave.

O come, Thou Day- Spring, come _ _ and cheer
Our spir- its by Thine ad - - vent here
Dis- perse the gloom- y clouds _ of night
And death’s dark shad- ows put _ _ to flight.

O come, Thou Key of Da - - vid, come,
And o- pen wide our heav'n - - ly home;
Where all Thy saints with Thee _ shall dwell~
O come, O come, Em- ma - - nu- el.
