It came up- on _ the mid- night clear,
That glo - rious song _ of old, 
From an- gels bend - ing near the earth,
To touch their harps _ of gold; 
“Peace on the earth, _ good will to men,
From Heav'n’s _ all gra - cious King.” 
The world in sol - emn still- ness lay,
To hear the an - gels sing.

Still through the clo - ven skies they come
With peace - ful wings _ un- furled, 
And still their heav'n - ly mu- sic floats
O’er all the wea - ry world; 
A- bove its sad _ and low- ly plains,
They bend _ on hov - 'ring wing, 
And ev- er o'er _ its Ba- bel sounds
The bless- èd an - gels sing.

And ye, be- neath _ life’s crush- ing load,
Whose forms _ are bend - ing low, 
Who toil a- long _ the climb- ing way
With pain- ful steps _ and slow, 
Look now! for glad _ and gold- en hours
Come swift - ly on _ the wing. 
O rest be- side _ the wea- ry road,
And hear the an - gels sing!

For lo! the days _ are has- t'ning on,
By proph - et- bards _ fore- told, 
When with the ev - er cir- cling years
Comes round the age _ of gold; 
When peace shall o - ver all the earth
Its an - cient splen - dors fling, 
And the whole world _ send back the song
Which now the an - gels sing.
