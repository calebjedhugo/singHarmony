Hark! the her- ald an- gels sing
Glo- ry to the new- born King;
Peace on earth and mer- cy mild,
God and sin- ners rec- on- ciled:
Joy- ful all ye na- tions rise,
Join the tri- umph of the skies,
With the an- gel- ic host pro- claim,
Christ is born in Beth- le- hem:
Hark! the her- ald an- gels sing
Glo- ry to the new- born King.

Christ, by high- est heav- en a- dored,
Christ, the ev- er- last- ing Lord,
Late in time be- hold him come,
Off- spring of a vir- gin’s womb!
Veiled in flesh the God- head see,
Hail the in- car- nate De- i- ty!
Pleased as man with men to dwell,
Je- sus, our Em- ma- nu- el:
Hark! the her- ald an- gels sing
Glo- ry to the new- born King.

Hail the heav- en- born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of Right- eous- ness!
Light and life to all he brings,
Ris- en with heal- ing in his wings;
Mild, he lays his glo- ry by,
Born that man no more may die,
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them sec- ond birth:
Hark! the her- ald an- gels sing
Glo- ry to the new- born King.

Come, de- sire of na- tions, come,
Fix in us thy hum- ble home;
Rise, the wom- an’s con- quer- ing seed,
Bruise in us the ser- pent’s head.
Ad- am’s like- ness, Lord, ef- face,
Stamp thy im- age in its place.
Sec- ond Ad- am from a- bove,
Re- in- state us in thy love.
Hark! the her- ald an- gels sing
Glo- ry to the new- born King.
