Hark! the her- ald an- gels sing _
Glo- ry to the new- born King;
Peace on earth and mer- cy mild, _
God and sin- ners rec- on- ciled:
Joy- ful all ye na- tions rise, _
Join the tri- umph of the skies, _
With th'an- gel- ic host pro- claim,
Christ is _ born in Beth- le- hem:
Hark! the her- ald an- gels sing
Glo- ry _ to the new- born King.

Christ, by high- est heav'n a- dored, _
Christ, the ev- er- last- ing Lord,
Late in time be- hold him come, _
Off- spring of a vir- gin’s womb!
Veiled in flesh the God- head see, _
Hail th'in- car- nate De- i- ty! _
Pleased as man with men to dwell,
Je- sus, _ our Em- ma- nu- el:

Hail the heav'n- born Prince of Peace! _
Hail the Sun of Right- eous- ness!
Light and life to all he brings, _
Ris'n with heal- ing in his wings;
Mild, he lays his glo- ry by, _
Born that man no more may die, _
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to _ give them sec- ond birth:

Come, de- sire of na- tions, come, _
Fix in us thy hum- ble home;
Rise, the wom- an’s con- q'ring seed, _
Bruise in us the ser- pent’s head.
Ad- am’s like- ness, Lord, ef- face, _
Stamp thy im- age in its place. _
Sec- ond Ad- am from a- bove,
Re- in - state us in thy love.
