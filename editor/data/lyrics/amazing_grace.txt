A- maz- ing4 grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a4 wretch like me!
I once2 was4 lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

’Twas grace that4 taught my heart to fear,
And grace my4 fears re- lieved;
How pre-2 cious4 did that grace ap- pear
The hour I first be- lieved!

The Lord has4 prom- ised good to me,
His Word my4 hope se- cures;
He will2 my4 Shield and Por- tion be,
As long as life en- dures.

Through man- y4 dan- gers, toils and snares,
I have al-4 read- y come;
’Tis grace2 hath4 brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

When we’ve been4 there ten thou- sand years,
Bright shin- ing4 as the sun,
We’ve no2 less4 days to sing God’s praise
Than when we’d first be- gun.
