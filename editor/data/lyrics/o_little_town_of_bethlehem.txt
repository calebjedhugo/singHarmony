O lit- tle town of Beth- le- hem, how still we see thee lie!
A- bove thy deep and dream- less sleep the si- lent stars go by.
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the ev- er- last- ing Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee to- night.

For Christ is born of Mar- y, and gath- ered all a- bove,
While mor- tals sleep, the an- gels keep their watch of won- der- ing love.
O morn- ing stars to- geth- er, pro- claim the ho- ly birth,
And prais- es sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth!

How si- lent- ly, how si- lent- ly, the won- drous Gift is giv’n;
So God im- parts to hu- man hearts the bless- ings of His Heav’n.
No ear may hear His com- ing, but in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will re- ceive Him still, the dear Christ en- ters in.

O ho- ly Child of Beth- le- hem, de- scend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and en- ter in, be born in us to- day.
We hear the Christ- mas an- gels the great glad tid- ings tell;
O come to us, a- bide with us, our Lord Em- ma- nu- el!
