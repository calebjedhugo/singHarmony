Come, Thou Fount of eve- ry bless- ing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mer- cy, nev- er ceas- ing,
Call for songs of loud- est praise.
Teach me _ some me- lo- dious son - net,
Sung by _ flam- ing tongues a- bove.
Praise the mount! I’m fixed up- on it,
Mount of God’s un- chang- ing love.

Here I raise my Eb- e- ne- zer;
Here by Thy great help I’ve come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleas- ure,
Safe- ly to ar- rive at home.
Je- sus _ sought me when a stran - ger,
Wan- d'ring _ from the fold of God;
He, to res- cue me from dan- ger,
In- ter- posed His pre- cious blood;

O to grace how great a debt- or
Dai- ly I’m con- strained to be!
Let Thy grace now, like a fet- ter,
Bind my wan- d'ring heart to Thee.
Prone to _ wan- der, Lord, I feel _ it,
Prone to _ leave the God I love;
Here’s my heart, O take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts a- bove.
