My coun- try, ’tis of thee,
Sweet land of lib- er- ty,
Of thee I sing;
Land where my fa- thers died,
Land of the pil- grims’ pride,
From eve - ry _ moun- tain- side,
Let _ free- dom ring!

My na- tive coun- try, thee,
Land of the no- ble free,
Thy name I love;
I love thy rocks and rills,
Thy woods and tem- pled hills;
My heart _ with _ rap- ture thrills,
Like _ that a- bove.

Let mu- sic swell the breeze,
And ring from all the trees,
Sweet free- dom’s song;
Let mor- tal tongues a- wake;
Let all that breathe par- take;
Let rocks _ their _ si- lence break,
The _ sound pro- long.

Our fa- thers’ God, to Thee,
Au- thor of lib- er- ty,
To Thee we sing;
Long may our land be bright
With free- dom’s ho- ly light;
Pro- tect _ us _ by Thy might,
Great _ God, our King.
