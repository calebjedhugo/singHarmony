I heard the bells on Christ- mas day
Their old fa- mil- i- ar car- ols play,
And wild and sweet the words re- peat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

I thought how, as the day had come,
The bel- fries of all Chris- ten- dom
Had rolled a- long the un- bro- ken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And in de- spair I bowed my head
“There is no peace on earth,” I said,
“For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.”

Yet pealed the bells more loud and deep:
“God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right pre- vail
With peace on earth, good will to men.”

The ring- ing, sing- ing on its way
The world re- volved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sub- lime
Of peace on earth, good will to men.
