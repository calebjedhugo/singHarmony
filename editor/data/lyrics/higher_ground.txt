I’m press- ing on the up- ward way,
New heights I’m gain- ing eve- ry day;
Still pray- ing as I’m on- ward bound,
“Lord, plant my feet on high- er ground.”
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith, on Heav- en’s ta- ble land,
A high- er plane than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on high- er ground.

My heart has no de- sire to stay
Where doubts a- rise and fears dis- may;
Though some may dwell where those a- bound,
My prayer, my aim, is high- er ground.

I want to live a- bove the world,
Though Sa- tan’s darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joy- ful sound,
The song of saints on high- er ground.

I want to scale the ut- most height
And catch a gleam of glo- ry bright;
But still I’ll pray till Heav’n I’ve found,
“Lord, plant my feet on high- er ground.”
