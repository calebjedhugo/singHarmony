The _ first _ No - el the _ an- gel did say
Was to cer- tain poor shep- herds in fields as they lay;
In _ fields _ where _ they lay _ tend- ing their sheep,
On a cold win- terâ€™s night _ that was _ so deep.
No - el, _ No - el, No - el, No- el,
Born is the King _ of Is - ra- el.

Then _ did _ ap - pear a _ won - drous star
Shin- ing in _ the east, _ be- yond _ them far;
Un - to _ the _ earth it _ gave _ great light,
And _ so it con- tin- ued both day _ and night.

And _ by _ the _ light of _ that _ same star
Three _ Wise _ Men came _ from coun - try far;
To _ seek _ for a King was _ their _ in- tent,
And to fol- low the star _ wher- ev- er it went.

Now _ let _ us _ all with _ one _ ac- cord
Sing _ prais - es to _ our heav'n - ly Lord;
That _ hath _ made _ Heav-n and _ earth _ of naught,
And _ with _ His blood _ man- kind _ hath bought.
