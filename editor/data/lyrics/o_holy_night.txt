O ho- ly night, _ the stars are bright- ly shin- ing;
It is the night of the dear Sav- ior’s birth!
Long lay the world _ in sin and er- ror pin- ing,
Till He ap- peared and the soul felt its worth. _ _
A thrill of hope, the wea- ry soul re- joic- es,
For yon- der breaks a new and glo- rious morn.
Fall _ on your knees, _ _ O hear _ the an- gel voic- es! _
O night _ _ di- vine, _ O _ night _ when Christ was born! _
O night, _ O ho - ly night, _ O night di- vine!

Led by the light _ of faith se- rene- ly beam- ing,
With glow- ing hearts by His cra- dle we stand.
So led by light _ of a star sweet- ly gleam- ing,
Here came the wise men from O- ri- ent land. _ _
The King of kings lay thus in low- ly man- ger,
In all our tri- als born to be our Friend!
He _ knows our need— _ to our weak - ness is no stran- ger. _
Be- hold _ _ your King; _ be - fore _ Him low- ly bend! _
Be- hold _ your King; _ be- fore _ Him low- ly bend!

Tru- ly He taught _ us to love one an- oth- er;
His law is love and His Gos- pel is peace.
Chains shall He break _ for the slave is our broth- er
And in His Name all op- pres- sion shall cease. _ _
Sweet hymns of joy in grate- ful cho- rus raise we,
Let all with- in us praise His ho- ly Name!
Christ _ is the Lord! _ _ O praise _ His name for- ev- er! _
His pow’r _ _ and glo - ry _ ev - er- more pro- claim! _
His pow’r _ and glo - ry ev - er- more pro- claim!
