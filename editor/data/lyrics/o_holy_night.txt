O ho- ly night, the stars are bright- ly shin- ing;
It is the night of the dear Sav- ior’s birth!
Long lay the world in sin and er- ror pin- ing,
Till He ap- peared and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope, the wea- ry soul re- joic- es,
For yon- der breaks a new and glo- ri- ous morn.
Fall on your knees, O hear the an- gel voic- es!
O night di- vine, O night when Christ was born!
O night, O ho- ly night, O night di- vine!

Led by the light of faith se- rene- ly beam- ing,
With glow- ing hearts by His cra- dle we stand.
So led by light of a star sweet- ly gleam- ing,
Here came the wise men from O- ri- ent land.
The King of kings lay thus in low- ly man- ger,
In all our tri- als born to be our Friend!
He knows our need—to our weak- ness is no stran- ger.
Be- hold your King; be- fore Him low- ly bend!
Be- hold your King; be- fore Him low- ly bend!

Tru- ly He taught us to love one an- oth- er;
His law is love and His Gos- pel is peace.
Chains shall He break for the slave is our broth- er
And in His Name all op- pres- sion shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grate- ful cho- rus raise we,
Let all with- in us praise His ho- ly Name!
Christ is the Lord! O praise His name for- ev- er!
His pow’r and glo- ry ev- er- more pro- claim!
His pow’r and glo- ry ev- er- more pro- claim!
