A- las! and did my Sav- ior bleed
And did my Sov- ’reign die?
Would He de- vote that sa- cred head
For such a worm as I?
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,
And the bur- den of my heart rolled a- way,
It was there by faith I re- ceived my sight,
And now I am hap- py all the day!

Was it for crimes that I had done
He groaned up- on the tree?
A- maz- ing pit- y! grace un- known!
And love be- yond de- gree!

Well might the sun in dark- ness hide
And shut his glo- ries in,
When Christ, the might- y Mak- er died,
For man the crea- ture’s sin.

But drops of grief can ne’er re- pay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give my- self a- way,
’Tis all that I can do.
