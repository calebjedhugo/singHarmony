Won- der- ful grace of Je- sus,
Great- er than all my sin;
How shall my tongue de- scribe it,
Where shall its praise be- gin?
Tak- ing a- way my bur- den,
Set- ting my spir- it free; 
For the won- der- ful grace of Je- sus reach- es me.
Won- der- ful the match- less grace the match- less grace of Je- sus,
Deep- er than the might- y roll- ing sea the roll- in sea;
Won- der- ful grace, all suf- fi- cient for me, for e- ven me.
Broad- er than the scope of my trans- gres- sions,
Great- er far than all my sin and shame,
O mag- ni- fy the pre- cious Name of Je- sus.
Praise His Name!

Won- der- ful grace of Je- sus,
Reach- ing to all the lost,
By it I have been par- doned,
Saved to the ut- ter- most,
Chains have been torn a- sun- der,
Giv- ing me lib- er- ty; 
For the won- der- ful grace of Je- sus reach- es me.
       of Je-    sus

Won- der- ful grace of Je- sus,
Reach- ing the most de- filed,
By its trans- form- ing pow- er,
Mak- ing him Godâ€™s dear child,
Pur- chas- ing peace and heav- en,
For all e- ter- ni- ty; 
And the won- der- ful grace of Je- sus reach- es me.
