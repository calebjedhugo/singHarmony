How _ firm a foun- da- tion, ye saints of the Lord,
Is _ laid for your faith in His ex- cel- lent Word!
What more can He say than to you He hath said,
To _ you, who for ref- uge to Je- sus have fled?

“Fear _ not, I am with thee, O be not dis- mayed,
For _ I am thy God and will still give thee aid;
I’ll strength- en and help thee, and cause thee to stand
Up - held by My right- eous, om- nip- o- tent hand.

“When _ through the deep wa- ters I call thee to go,
The _ riv- ers of woe shall not thee o- ver- flow;
For I will be with thee, thy trou- bles to bless,
And _ sanc- ti- fy to thee thy deep- est dis- tress.

“When _ through fier- y tri- als thy path- ways shall lie,
My _ grace, all suf- fi- cient, shall be thy sup- ply;
The flame shall not hurt thee; I on- ly de- sign
Thy _ dross to con- sume, and thy gold to re- fine.

“The _ soul that on Je- sus hath leaned for re- pose,
I _ will not, I will not de- sert to its foes;
That soul, though all hell should en- deav- or to shake,
I’ll _ nev- er, no nev- er, no nev- er for- sake.”
