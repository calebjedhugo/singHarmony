Blest be _ the tie _ that binds
Our hearts _ in Chris - tian love;
The fel - low- ship _ of kin - dred minds _
Is like _ to that _ a- bove.

Be- fore _ our Fa - therâ€™s throne
We pour _ our ar - dent prayers;
Our fears _, our hopes _, our aims _ are one _
Our com - forts and _ our cares.

We share _ our mu - tual woes,
Our mu - tual bur - dens bear;
And of - ten for _ each oth - er flows _
The sym - pa- thiz - ing tear.

When we _ a- sun - der part,
It gives _ us in - ward pain;
But we _ shall still _ be joined _ in heart, _
And hope _ to meet _ a- gain.
