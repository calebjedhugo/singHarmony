Just _ as I am, _ with- out _ one plea,
But that _ Thy blood was shed for me,
And _ that Thou bidst _ me come to Thee, _
O Lamb of God, _ I come, I come.

Just _ as I am, _ and wait - ing not
To rid _ my soul of one dark blot,
To _ Thee whose blood _ can cleanse each spot, _

Just _ as I am, _ though tossed _ a- bout
With many _ a con- flict, many a doubt,
Fight - ings and fears _ with- in, with- out, _

Just _ as I am, _ poor, wretch - ed, blind;
Sight, rich - es, heal- ing of the mind,
Yea, _ all I need _ in Thee to find, _

Just _ as I am, _ Thou wilt _ re- ceive,
Wilt wel - come, par- don, cleanse, re- lieve;
Be - cause Thy prom - ise I be- lieve, _
