A- way in a man- ger, no crib for a bed,
The lit- tle Lord Je- sus laid down His sweet head.
The stars in the sky2 looked down where He lay,
The lit- tle Lord Je- sus, a- sleep on the hay.

The cat- tle are low- ing, the Ba- by a- wakes,
But lit- tle Lord Je- sus, no cry- ing He makes;
I love Thee, Lord Je- sus, look down from the sky
And stay by my cra- dle till morn- ing is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Je- sus, I ask Thee to stay
Close by me for- ev- er, and love me, I pray;
Bless all the dear chil- dren in Thy ten- der care,
And fit us for Heav- en to live with Thee there.
