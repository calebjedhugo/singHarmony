Si - lent night! Ho - ly night
All is calm all is bright
Round yong vir - gin moth- er and child
Ho- ly in- fant so ten- der and mild
Sleep in heav- en- ly peace! _
Sleep _ in heav- en- ly peace!

Si - lent night! Ho - ly night!
Shep- herds quake at the sight
Glo- ries stream _ from heav- en a- far
Heav'n- ly hosts _ sing Hal- le- lu- jah
Christ the Sav- iour is born! _
Christ _ the Sav- iour is born!

Si - lent night! Ho - ly night!
Son of God loveâ€™s pure light
Ra- diant beams _ from thy ho- ly face
With the dawn of re- deem - ing grace,
Je- sus, Lord at thy birth, _
Je - sus, Lord at thy birth.
