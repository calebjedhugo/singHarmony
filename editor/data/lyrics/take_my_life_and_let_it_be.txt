Take my life _ and _ let it be con- se- crat - ed, _ Lord, to _ Thee.
Take my mo- ments _ and my days; _ let them flow in cease - less _ praise. _ let them flow in _ cease- less praise.

Take my hands _ and _ let them move at the im - pulse _ of Thy _ love. Take my feet and _ let them be _ swift and beau- ti- ful _ for _ Thee. _ Swift and beau- ti - ful for Thee.

Take my voice _ and _ let me sing al- ways, on - ly, _ for my _ King. Take my lips and _ let them be _ filled with mes- sag- es _ from _ Thee. _ Filled with mes- sag - es from Thee.

Take my sil - ver _ and my gold; not a mite _ would _ I with - hold.
Take my in- tel - lect and use _ eve- ry pow'r as Thou _ shalt _ choose. _ Eve- ry pow'r as _ Thou shalt choose.

Take my will _ and _ make it Thine; it shall be _ no _ long- er _ mine. Take my heart it _ is Thine own; _ it shall be Thy roy - al _ throne. _ It shall be Thy _ roy- al throne.

Take my love _ my _ Lord, I pour at Thy feet _ its _ treas- ure _ store. Take my- self and _ I will be _ ev- er, on- ly, all _ for _ Thee. _ Ev- er, on- ly, _ all for Thee.
