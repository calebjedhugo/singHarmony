O come, all ye faith- ful, joy- ful and tri- um- phant,
Come ye, O come _ ye, to Beth - le- hem.
Come and be- hold Him, born the King of an - gels;
O come, let us a- dore Him,
O come, let us a- dore Him,
O come, let us a- dore Him, _
Christ _ the Lord.

 Sing, choirs of an- gels, sing in ex- ul- ta- tion;
Sing, all ye bright _ hosts of heav'n _ a- bove!
Glo- ry to God, all glo- ry in the high - est;

 Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this hap- py morn- ing;
Je- sus, to Thee _ be all glo - ry giv'n;
Word of the Fa- ther, now in flesh ap- pear - ing.
