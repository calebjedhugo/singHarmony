Joy- ful, joy- ful, we a- dore Thee, God of glo- ry, Lord of love;
Hearts un- fold like flow'rs be- fore Thee, o- p'ning to the sun a- bove.
Melt the clouds of sin and _ sad- ness; drive the _ dark of doubt a- way;
Giv- er of im- mor- tal glad- ness, fill us with the light of day!

All Thy works with joy sur- round Thee, earth and heav'n re- flect Thy rays,
Stars and an- gels sing a- round Thee, cen- ter of un- bro- ken praise.
Field and for- est, vale and _ moun- tain, flow'r- y _ mead- ow, flash- ing sea,
Chant- ing bird and flow- ing foun- tain call us to re- joice in Thee.

Thou art giv- ing and for- giv- ing, ev- er bless- ing, ev- er blessed,
Well- spring of the joy of liv- ing, o- cean depth of hap- py rest!
Thou our Fa- ther, Christ our _ Broth- er, all who _ live in love are Thine;
Teach us how to love each oth- er, lift us to the joy di- vine.

Mor- tals, join the might- y cho- rus, which the morn- ing stars be- gan;
Fa- ther love is reign- ing oâ€™er us, broth- er love binds man to man.
Ev- er sing- ing, march we _ on- ward, vic- tors _ in the midst of strife,
Joy- ful mu- sic leads us sun- ward in the tri- umph song of life.
