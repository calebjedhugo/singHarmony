While by the sheep we watched at night,
Glad tid- ings brought an an- gel bright.
How great our joy! Great our joy!
Joy, joy, joy! Joy, joy, joy!
Praise we the Lord in heav- en on high!
Praise we the Lord in heav- en on high!

There shall be born, so He did say,
In Beth- le- hem a Child to- day.

There shall the Child lie in a stall,
This Child who shall re- deem us all.

This gift of God weâ€™ll cher- ish well,
That ev- er joy our hearts shall fill.
