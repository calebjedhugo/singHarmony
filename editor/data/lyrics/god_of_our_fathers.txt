God of our fa- thers, whose al- might- y hand
Leads forth in beau- ty all the star- ry band
Of shin- ing worlds in splen- dor through the skies
Our grate- ful songs be- fore Thy throne a- rise.

Thy love di- vine hath led us in the past,
In this free land by Thee our lot is cast,
Be Thou our Rul- er, Guard- ian, Guide and Stay,
Thy Word our law, Thy paths our cho- sen way.

From warâ€™s a- larms, from dead- ly pes- ti- lence,
Be Thy strong arm our ev- er sure de- fense;
Thy true re- li- gion in our hearts in- crease,
Thy boun- teous good- ness nour- ish us in peace.

Re- fresh Thy peo- ple on their toil- some way,
Lead us from night to nev- er end- ing day;
Fill all our lives with love and grace di- vine,
And glo- ry, laud, and praise be ev- er Thine.
