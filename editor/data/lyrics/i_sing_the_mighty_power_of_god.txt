I sing the might- y pow- er of God, That made the moun- tains rise,
That spread the flow- ing seas a- broad, And built the loft- y skies.
I sing the wis- dom that or- dained The sun to rule the day;
The moon shines full at his com- mand, And all the stars o- bey.

I sing the good- ness of the Lord, Who filled the earth with food;
He formed the crea- tures with His word, And then pro- nounced them good.
Lord, how Thy won- ders are dis- played, Where’er I turn my eye:
If I sur- vey the ground I tread, Or gaze up- on the sky!

There’s not a plant or flow- er be- low, But makes Thy glo- ries known;
And clouds a- rise, and tem- pests blow, By or- der from Thy throne;
While all that bor- rows life from Thee Is ev- er in Thy care,
And eve- ry- where that man can be, Thou, God art pre- sent there.
