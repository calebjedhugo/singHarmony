I sing the _ might- y pow'r of God, That made _ the moun- tains rise,
That spread the _ flow- ing seas a- broad, And built _ the loft- y skies.
I _ sing the wis- dom that or - dained The _ sun to rule the day;
The moon shines _ full at his com- mand, And all _ the stars o- bey.

I sing the _ good- ness of the Lord, Who filled _ the earth with food;
He formed the _ crea- tures with His word, And then _ pro- nounced them good.
Lord, _ how Thy won- ders are dis - played, Wher - e’er I turn my eye:
If I sur - vey the ground I tread, Or gaze _ up- on the sky!

There’s not a _ plant or flow'r be- low, But makes _ Thy glo- ries known;
And clouds a - rise, and tem- pests blow, By or - der from Thy throne;
While _ all that bor- rows life from _ Thee Is _ ev- er in Thy care,
And eve - ry- where that man can be, Thou, God _ art pre- sent there.
