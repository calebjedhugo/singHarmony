As with glad- ness, men of old
Did the guid- ing star be- hold
As with joy they hailed its light
Lead- ing on- ward, beam- ing bright
So, most glo- ri- ous Lord, may we
Ev- er- more be led to Thee.

As with joy- ful steps they sped
To that low- ly man- ger bed
There to bend the knee be- fore
Him Whom Heav- en and earth a- dore;
So may we with will- ing feet
Ev- er seek Thy mer- cy seat.

As they of- fered gifts most rare
At that man- ger rude and bare;
So may we with ho- ly joy,
Pure and free from sinâ€™s al- loy,
All our cost- li- est treas- ures bring,
Christ, to Thee, our heav- en- ly King.

Ho- ly Je- sus, eve- ry day
Keep us in the nar- row way;
And, when earth- ly things are past,
Bring our ran- somed souls at last
Where they need no star to guide,
Where no clouds Thy glo- ry hide.
