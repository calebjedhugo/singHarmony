When peace, like a riv- er, at- tend - eth my way,
When sor- rows like sea bil- lows roll;
What- ev- er my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
It is well, it is well, with my soul.
It is well,  with my soul. 
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

Though Sa- tan should buf- fet, though tri - als should come,
Let this blest as- sur- ance con- trol,
That Christ has re- gard- ed my help- less es- tate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glo - ri- ous thought!
My sin, not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

And Lord, haste the day when my faith _ shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall re- sound, and the Lord shall de- scend,
E- ven so, it is well with my soul.
