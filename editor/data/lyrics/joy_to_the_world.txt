Joy to the world! the Lord is come;
Let earth re- ceive her King;
Let eve- ry heart pre- pare him room,
And heav- en and na- ture sing,
And heav- en and na- ture sing,
And heav- en, and heav- en, and na- ture sing.

Joy to the world! the Sav- iour reigns;
Let men their songs em- ploy;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
Re- peat the sound- ing joy,
Re- peat the sound- ing joy,
Re- peat, re- peat the sound- ing joy.

No more let sins and sor- rows grow,
Nor thorns in- fest the ground;
He comes to make His bless- ings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as, the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the na- tions prove
The glo- ries of His right- eous- ness,
And won- ders of His love,
And won- ders of His love,
And won- ders, won- ders, of His love.
