Joy to the world! the Lord is come;
Let earth re- ceive her King;
Let eve - ry _ heart _ _ pre- pare _ him _ room, _ _
And heav'n and na- ture  sing,
And  heav'n and na- ture  sing,
And  heav'en, _ and heav'n, _ _ and na- ture sing.

Joy to the world! the Sav- iour reigns;
Let men their songs em- ploy;
While fields _ and _ floods, _ _ rocks, hills, _ and _ plains _ _
Re- peat the sound- ing _ joy,
Re - peat the sound- ing _ joy,
Re - peat, _ re- peat _ _ the sound- ing joy.

No more let sins and sor- rows grow,
Nor thorns in- fest the ground;
He comes _ to _ make _ _ His bless - ings _ flow _ _
Far as the curse is _ found,
Far _ as the curse is _ found,
Far _ as, _ far as, _ _ the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the na- tions prove
The glo - ries _ of _ _ His right - eous - ness, _ _
And won- ders of His _ love,
And _ won- ders of His _ love,
And _ won - ders, won - - ders, of His love.
