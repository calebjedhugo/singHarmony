Go to dark Geth- sem- a- ne, you that feel the tempt- er’s pow'r;
Your Re- deem- er’s con- flict see, watch with Him one bit- ter hour,
Turn not from His griefs a- way; learn of Je- sus Christ to pray.

Fol- low to the judg- ment hall, View the Lord of life ar- raigned;
O the worm- wood and the gall! O the pangs His soul sus- tained!
Shun not suff'r- ing, shame or loss; Learn of Him to bear the cross.

Cal- v'ry’s mourn- ful moun- tain climb; There, a- dor- ing at His feet,
Mark the mir- a- cle of time, God’s own sac- ri- fice com- plete:
“It is fin- ished!” hear Him cry; Learn of Je- sus Christ to die.
