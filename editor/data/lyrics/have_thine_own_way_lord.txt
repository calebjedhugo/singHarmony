Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Thou art the Pot- ter, I am the clay.
Mold me and make me af- ter Thy will,
While I am wait- ing, yield- ed and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me, Mas- ter, to- day!
Whit- er than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
As in Thy pres- ence hum- bly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Wound- ed and wea- ry, help me, I pray!
Pow- er, all pow- er, sure- ly is Thine!
Touch me and heal me, Sav- ior di- vine.

Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Hold o’er my be- ing ab- so- lute sway!
Fill with Thy Spir- it ’till all shall see
Christ on- ly, al- ways, liv- ing in me.
