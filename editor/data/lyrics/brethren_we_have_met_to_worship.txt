Breth- ren, _ we have met to _ wor - ship _ and a - dore the Lord our God;
Will you _ pray with all your _ pow - er, _ while we _ try to preach the Word?
All is vain un- less the _ Spir- it of the Ho- ly One comes _ down;
Breth- ren _, pray, and ho- ly _ man - na _ will be _ show- ered all a- round.

Breth- ren, _ see poor sin- ners _ round _ you _ slum- b'ring _ on the brink of woe;
Death is _ com- ing, hell is _ mov - ing, _ can you _ bear to let them go?
See our fa- thers and our _ moth- ers, and our chil- dren sink- ing _ down;
Breth- ren, _ pray and ho- ly _ man - na _ will be _ show- ered all a- round.

Sis- ters, _ will you join and _ help _ us? _ Mo- ses’ _ sis- ter aid- ed him;
Will you _ help the trem- bling _ mourn - ers _ who are _ strug- gling hard with sin?
Tell them all a- bout the _ Sav- ior, tell them that He will be _ found;
Sis- ters, _ pray, and ho- ly _ man - na _ will be _ show- ered all a- round.

Let us _ love our God su - preme - ly, _ let us _ love each oth- er, too;
Let us _ love and pray for _ sin - ners, _ till our _ God makes all things new.
Then He’ll call us home to _ Heav- en, at His ta- ble we’ll sit _ down;
Christ will _ gird Him self and _ serve _ us _ with sweet _ man- na all a- round.
