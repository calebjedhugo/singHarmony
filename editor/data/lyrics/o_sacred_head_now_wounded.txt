O sa- cred Head, now wound- ed,
with grief and shame weighed down;
now scorn- ful- ly sur- round- ed
with thorns, thine on- ly crown;
How art though pale with an- guish,
With sore a- buse and scorn!
How does that vis- age lan- guish
Which once was bright as morn.

What thou, my Lord, hast suf- fered
was all for sin- ners’ gain:
mine, mine was the trans- gres- sion,
but thine the dead- ly pain.
Lo, here I fall, my Sav- ior!
‘Tis I de- serve thy place;
look on me with thy fa- vor,
vouch- safe to me thy grace.

What lan- guage shall I bor- row
to thank thee, dear- est Friend,
for this, thy dy- ing sor- row,
thy pit- y with- out end?
O make me thine for- ev- er;
and should I faint- ing be,
Lord, let me nev- er, nev- er
out- live my love to thee.
