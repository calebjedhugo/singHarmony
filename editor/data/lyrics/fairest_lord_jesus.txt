Fair- est Lord Je- sus! Rul- er of all na- ture!
O Thou of God and man the Son,
Thee will I cher- ish, Thee will I hon- or,
Thou, my soulâ€™s glo- ry, joy and crown.

Fair are the mead- ows, Fair- er still the wood- lands,
Robed in the bloom- ing garb of spring:
Je- sus is fair- er, Je- sus is pur- er,
Who makes the woe- ful heart to sing.

Fair is the sun- shine, Fair- er still the moon- light,
And all the twin- kling star- ry host:
Je- sus shines bright- er, Je- sus shines pur- er
Than all the an- gels heav- en can boast.

Beau- ti- ful Sav- ior! Lord of all the na- tions!
Son of God and Son of Man!
Glo- ry and hon- or, praise, ad- o- ra- tion,
Now and for- ev- er more be Thine.
