God rest ye mer- ry, gen- tle- men,
Let noth- ing you dis- may,
For Je- sus Christ our Sav - iour
Was born up- on this day,
To save us all from Sa- tanâ€™s pow'r
When we were gone a- stray
O _ tid- ings of com - fort and joy,
com- fort and joy,
O _ tid - ings of com - fort and joy.

From God our heav'n- ly Fa - ther
A bless- ed an- gel came,
And un- to cer- tain shep - herds
Brought tid- ings of the same,
How that in Beth- le- hem was born
The Son of God by name.

The shep- herds at those tid - ings
Re- joic'd _ much in mind,
And left their flocks a- feed - ing
In tem- pest, storm and wind,
And went to Beth- le- hem straight- way,
This bless- ed Babe to find.

But when to Beth- le- hem they came,
Where- at this In- fant lay,
They found Him in a man - ger,
Where ox- en feed on hay;
His moth- er Mar- y kneel - ing,
Un- to the Lord did pray.

Now to the Lord sing prais - es,
All you with- in this place,
And with true love and broth- er- hood
Each oth- er now em- brace;
This ho- ly tide of Christ - mas
All oth- er doth de- face.
