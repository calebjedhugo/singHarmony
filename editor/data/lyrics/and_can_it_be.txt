And can it be that I2 should2 gain
An in-2 ter- est in the2 Sav- ior’s blood?
Died He for me, - who caused His pain—
For me, -2 who Him -2 to death pur- sued?
A- maz- ing love! How2 can2 it2 be, - -
That Thou,2 -4 my God,2 -4 shouldst die2 -4 for me?
A- maz- ing love! How can it be,
That Thou, my God, shouldst2 die for me?

He left His Fa- ther’s throne2 a-2 bove
So free,2 so2 in- fi-2 nite His grace—
Emp- tied Him- self - of all but love,
And bled -2 for Ad- -2 am’s help- less race:
’Tis mer- cy all, im-2 mense2 and2 free, - -
For O2 -4 my God,2 -4 it found2 -4 out me!

Long my im- pris- oned spir-2 it2 lay,
Fast bound2 in2 sin and2 na- ture’s night;
Thine eye dif- fused - a quick'n- ing ray—
I woke, -2 the dun- -2 geon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my2 heart2 was2 free, - -
I rose,2 -4 went forth,2 -4 and fol-2 -4 lowed Thee.

No con- dem- na- tion now2 I2 dread;
Je- sus,2 and2 all in2 Him, is mine;
A- live in Him -, my liv- ing Head,
And clothed -2 in right- -2 eous- ness di- vine,
Bold I ap- proach th’e-2 ter-2 nal2 throne, - -
And claim2 -4 the crown,2 -4 through Christ2 -4 my own.
